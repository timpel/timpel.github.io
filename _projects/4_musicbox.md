A Javascript app for making music. See the [source code](https://github.com/timpel/musicbox) or [try it out](http://timwp.com/musicbox2/) if you like.

You can loop playback, add tracks, add measures, change instruments, change key signatures, and save your creations. It's built with JavaScipt, particularly [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/).
