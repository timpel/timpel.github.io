A simple app built for my own use -- it provides an easy way to rename a bunch of images based on their timestamps. That means when I get back from a trip with pictures scattered across 2 phones and a camera, I can quickly give them chronologically sorted filenames before sharing or working with them. It helped me learn a bit of C#, too. Source code available on [Github](https://github.com/timpel/PhotoChron).
